    Error prone ExceptionSpecificity check to avoid catching too broadly

    Prefer more specific catch types than Exception and Throwable.
    When methods are updated to throw new checked exceptions they expect
    callers to handle failure types explicitly. Catching broad types defeats
    the type system. By catching the most specific types possible we
    leverage existing compiler functionality to detect unreachable code.
